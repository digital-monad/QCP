# the one we actually want to use (which can be switched really easily) to a class which has many algorithms implemented

# gate naming has to be consistent for this to work


class explicit_matrices:
    # this is going to be one implementation of the gates. Many will follow.
    # there may be better ways of creating this from a parent class if needed, depends how much can be reused between

    # weaknesses of this particular implementation (not exhaustive):
    # ~2 ^2n operations per gate application - v slow
    # gates generated each time- slow if they are used repeatedly (having the option to store may reduce time if say
    # we use hadamard again and again in one circuit, though storing adds to memory cost)
